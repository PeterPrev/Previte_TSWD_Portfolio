# Previte_TSWD_Portfolio
Peter Previte's Portfolio for 94870 - Telling Stories with Data

# About Me
My name is Pete Previte and I'm a second year student in Heinz' MISM-BIDA program. I am married with one child and I'm currently in the US Army.

# What I Hope to Learn
My main goals for takeaways from this course are to develop a more creative mind when thinking about ways to present data and to hone my skills at understanding what the most important aspects of different datasets are. I am excited to get more experience working with data, especially in creative and innovative ways in which I have not already worked with it.
