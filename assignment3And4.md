I chose to critique and redesign this data visualization because when I first looked at it, I thought, "wow, that's pretty useless." The chart attempts to detail trends in the league of legends player base. However, it is not very effective. The chart depicts two different pieces of data (average number of monthly players and peak daily players each month) and their change month to month. The chart also depicts the number change in average players as well as the percentage change in average players from month to month. These two new values are on such a massively smaller scale that it makes the entire chart hard to read and/or draw accurate conclusions. A redesign of this chart could make its story much more clear for readers interested in League of Legends data (like me!).
