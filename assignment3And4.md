# This is my submission for Assignment 3/4


## 1. Original Data Visualization

Below is the original data visualization that I will be critiquing for my assignment. The image can be found at the following link:

I chose to critique and redesign this data visualization because when I first looked at it, I thought, "wow, that's pretty useless." The chart attempts to detail trends in the league of legends player base. However, it is not very effective. The chart depicts two different pieces of data (average number of monthly players and peak daily players each month) and their change month to month. The chart also depicts the number change in average players as well as the percentage change in average players from month to month. These two new values are on such a massively smaller scale that it makes the entire chart hard to read and/or draw accurate conclusions. A redesign of this chart could make its story much more clear for readers interested in League of Legends data (like me!). 


## 2. Step-by-Step Thoughts During Assignment Progress


### Step One: Find a Data Visualization

At first, I wasn't sure what topic I wanted to be the focus for this assignment. I had a couple candidate topics in mind, the first of which is the rise in pickleball growth in the country. As I looked for charts and data around pickleball, I wasn't able to find many charts that were poorly done (which is a good thing in general, but not for this assignment!). Most of the charts I found were quite simple and done in a way that it was easy to understand what the chart was trying to say. I shifted towards a different topic with tons of data, the video game called League of Legends. A simple question I had in mind was: is the playerbase for League of Legends getting bigger or smaller (or staying the same)? I came across the website above relatively quickly and stumbled upon the chart pictured. It showed the data I needed to answer my question, at least in the recent past, but was displayed incredibly poorly. After a bit more searching I was able to find the data used to produce the chart so I decided this would be the focus for this assignment.


### Step Two: Critique the Data Visualization

The google form allowed us to explain our overall thoughts and observations about the visualization itself, its primary audience, and the evaluation method. On this page, I'll discuss my justification for each of the criteria in Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile.](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf)

Usefulness Score: 2
Few describes usefulness as a subjective score based on the assessment of the needs and values of others. Even if this chart's target audience is presented with this graph and they are hoping to answer the question this chart is trying to answer, the chart still isn't useful. The bars are placed so close to each other and the scale of the different metrics are so draastically different that a reader is unable to understand trends or patterns from the data. The chart does not facilitate the reader coming to accurate conclusions because the data is presented in a confusing/difficult-to-read way.

Completeness Score: 4
Based on Few's description, this chart is only somewhat complete. Titles and labels are correct, but there is not much context provided that help the reader understand if the data is good, bad, expected, unexpected, etc. The data itself is a timeline of month-to-month comparisons, which (if presented well) help the reader see trends over time. There are also pieces of information presented that are perhaps unnessary, such as including both the number value and percentage value in player change, which detracts from the completeness level.

Perceptibility: 4
The information is ultimately not presented in a manner that the human eye and brain can perceive with minimal effort. In other words, it is difficult to actually make out specific values for the different bars in the chart because the scale is way too large, the bars are too close to each other, and the bars are far from the axis values. At a zoomed out glance, the reader can understand the point of the chart, but the reader's eyes must move around too much to discern and align numbers with bars.

Truthfulness: 5
For the most part, the chart is truthful and represents what it claims. The bars are proportioned and, though difficult to read, they are created to scale given the axis values and the values in the inherent data. The biggest ding to the truthfulness is the "perentage change" piece of data. No where on the chart scale/axis values is a percentage value listed, so the bars representing the percentage change seem to be included in an arbitrary way. That is, we cannot tell by the scale if the percentage bars are accurate because the scale does not include a percentage value at all.

Intuitiveness: 5
The chart is overall intuitive because of its nature as a bar chart and, because of similar points mentioned in the truthfulness section, the bars seem to be proportional and line up with the axis values. A reader can easily understand what the _intent_ of the chart is. Other than the percentage issue mentioned above, the chart is intiuitive and most readers in the chart's target audience would easily be able to understand the goal of the chart.

Aesthetics: 2

Engagement: 3
