# Final Project: Part 1


## Project Outline

My final project is going to focus on the sport of Pickleball. Pickleball is (in my opinion) an incredibly fun activity that is becoming wildly popular in the U.S. at a ridiculously fast rate. For my final project submission, I'll be telling the story of Pickleball: what it is, why it's so popular, the great (and not so great) things about it, and why you should pick up a paddle and try it out for yourself. To show these things, I'll focus on depicting data surrounding picklball participation, player demographics, locations across the country which provide courts for play, and surveys from players about what they like and don't like about the sport. 

To start my presentation, I'll discuss generally what picklball is. Specifically, I'll brielfy give a quick comparison to other similar sports to help those unfamiliar with the sport to conceptualize it. Next, I'll talk about some of the reasons why Pickleball is so popular. I'll follow these points up with some data showing Pickleball's growth, likely compared to other similar sports' growth in recent years. I'll then talk about some of the complaints people have with Pickleball (after all, nothing is loved by everyone). From there, I'll show some projections on where the growth of Pickleball is likely to go in the future and finish off with a call to action. The overall purpose of this story (presentation) is to help inform those that are new to pickleball about the sport and the inform those that already participate in the sport some things to keep in mind when playing to mitigate the negative stereotypes that surround the sport. The call to action will be focused on those who are newer to Pickleball and will be to encourage those individuals to try it out and get involved with their local Pickleball community.


## Initial Sketches


## The Data

My data is relatively scattered between many different sources as opposed to one large dataset. Because Pickleball is a (relatively) new sport, much of the most recent data collected on player participation is not available for free. However, many journalists that have gotten a hold of that data have published articles containing bits and pieces of it. Some of my data will be a consolidation of the data reported in these articles that I make into a .csv of my own and some of my data will be downloaded directly from various sources (e.g. courts by state data). Below, I will post links to the URLs with data I will be using that I made into my own .csv files.
