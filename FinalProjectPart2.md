# Final Project Part 2


## Wirefames and Storyboard

For the wireframs and storyboard portion of the Part 2 submission, I'll be starting my Shorthand presentation. My goal at this stage in the project is to have at least 80% of the visualizations I intend to use in my final presentation. Based on user feedback later in Part 2, I will likely edit my existing visualizations and may potentially add new ones where appropriate. The link to my Shorthand presentation which houses my wireframes/storyboard portion of this assignment is below:

## User Research and Interviews

### Target Audience

The target audience for my story is two different groups of people: people who have never played Pickleball and don't know much about it, and people who are regular Pickleball players looking to become more knowledgeable about keeping the sport and community healthy. Much of my presentation is directed towards people who know nothing about Pickleball and may be looking for a new activity to pick up or a community to get involved in. Parts of my presentation will appeal to current Pickleball players because I'll discuss reasons why some people dislike the sport. My story then may help Pickleball players to avoid some of the mistakes that turn others away from the sport. Because the majority of my presentation will be directed towards individuals unfamiliar with Pickleball, that is the primary target audience for my story.

### Audience Approach

In order to get well-rounded feedback best suited to help me improve my presentation, I'll be interviewing two individuals in the primary target group (people unfamiliar with Pickleball) and I'll interview one person from the secondary target group (regular Pickleballer). I'll ask some generic questions to each target group, but will also ask individual questions based on the group they fall into.

### Interview Script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Determine whether the underlying message of my story is clear to the reader | What do you think the message of the presentation is? Would you say there is a "call to action?" If so, what is it? |
| Determine if charts and graphs used are clear and help the story | How did you feel about the charts used in the presentation? Were any of the charts particularly helpful in presenting the information? Were any of the charts particularly distracting? |
| Determine if the presentation provided enough background infromation on Pickleball to make the underlying message and the various data points and charts make sense | Do you feel like the presentation provided enough information about Pickleball to where the charts and data points were easy to follow/understand? |
| Determine if the message of the story is effective (Primary target group) | Do you feel inspired by the presentation to give Pickleball a try? Specifically, do you feel more, less, or about the same level of excitement about Pickleball and learning how to play than you did before the presentation? |
| Determine if the message of the story is effective (Secondary target group) | Did you know about the some of the different reasons why people dislike Pickleball? Do you feel like these things are problematic and/or fixable issues surrounding the sport? |
| See if there are any other areas in which the reader is unclear or feels information should be added/taken away to make the presentation more effective | Are there any other aspects of the presentation you felt were particuarly effective or innefective? Are there any parts of the presentation that you felt could have benefited from more information? |

### Interview Findings

| Questions | Interview 1 (Maale, Late 20s, Unfamiliar with Pickleball) | Interview 2 (Male, Mid 20s, Unfamiliar with Pickleball) | Interview 3 (Male, Mid-50s, Regular Pickleball Player) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| What do you think the message of the presentation is? Would you say there is a "call to action?" If so, what is it? | | | I felt like the message of the presentation was to tell people to get involved in pickleball. It also hinted at experienced pickleball players trying to "avoid" bothering people who don't like pickleball by not doing certain things, but I felt like this wasn't really developed as much as it should have been if this was the "call to action." |
| How did you feel about the charts used in the presentation? Were any of the charts particularly helpful in presenting the information? Were any of the charts particularly distracting? | | | I felt like the charts used were good, they were pretty basic but illustrated the points being made well. It felt like they lacked a little variety though, most of them were the same type of chart with bars, with the exception of one line chart. In the first chart, I liked the use of green to differentiate pickleball. None of them were distracting. Maybe some more variety would have been nice. |
| Do you feel like the presentation provided enough information about Pickleball to where the charts and data points were easy to follow/understand? | | | Yeah I think so, I obviously knew about the rules and how it's played before reading, but the facts about the number of players and the growth is pretty interesting and cool to see as an avid player. Nothing was difficult to understand after only a few seconds of looking at the chart. |
| Do you feel inspired by the presentation to give Pickleball a try? Specifically, do you feel more, less, or about the same level of excitement about Pickleball and learning how to play than you did before the presentation? | | | N/A |
| Did you know about the some of the different reasons why people dislike Pickleball? Do you feel like these things are problematic and/or fixable issues surrounding the sport? | | | I knew about some of the reasons, but never knew of any numbers behind the amount of people that felt one way or the other. Some of these things are definitely fixable issues, like the court space thing. Over time, more pickleball courts will be made which will make it easier for pickleball players and tennis players to coexist. The noise thing is pretty unavoidable. As for etiquette, this is something likely a result of the crowd pickleball attracts. Signs can be put up at courts with guidelines on etiquette, but that's as much as I feel would be necessary for that. |
| Are there any other aspects of the presentation you felt were particuarly effective or ineffective? Are there any parts of the presentation that you felt could have benefited from more information? | | | I definitely like the background images of pickleball and the different charts used. I think the "make sure not to upset anti-pickleballers" message isn't really effective or done well enough. Some more legitimate suggestions should be made if that's a serious point of the presentation. I understand that it still needs some more work and isn't finished yet so that is definitely something I would work on. |
