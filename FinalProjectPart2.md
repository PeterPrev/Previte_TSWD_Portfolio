# Final Project Part 2


## Wirefames and Storyboard

For the wireframs and storyboard portion of the Part 2 submission, I'll be starting my Shorthand presentation. My goal at this stage in the project is to have at least 80% of the visualizations I intend to use in my final presentation. Based on user feedback later in Part 2, I will likely edit my existing visualizations and may potentially add new ones where appropriate. The link to my Shorthand presentation which houses my wireframes/storyboard portion of this assignment is below:
