# Final Project Part 2


## Wirefames and Storyboard

For the wireframs and storyboard portion of the Part 2 submission, I'll be starting my Shorthand presentation. My goal at this stage in the project is to have at least 80% of the visualizations I intend to use in my final presentation. Based on user feedback later in Part 2, I will likely edit my existing visualizations and may potentially add new ones where appropriate. The link to my Shorthand presentation which houses my wireframes/storyboard portion of this assignment is below:

## User Research and Interviews

### Target Audience

The target audience for my story is two different groups of people: people who have never played Pickleball and don't know much about it, and people who are regular Pickleball players looking to become more knowledgeable about keeping the sport and community healthy. Much of my presentation is directed towards people who know nothing about Pickleball and may be looking for a new activity to pick up or a community to get involved in. Parts of my presentation will appeal to current Pickleball players because I'll discuss reasons why some people dislike the sport. My story then may help Pickleball players to avoid some of the mistakes that turn others away from the sport. Because the majority of my presentation will be directed towards individuals unfamiliar with Pickleball, that is the primary target audience for my story.

### Audience Approach

In order to get well-rounded feedback best suited to help me improve my presentation, I'll be interviewing two individuals in the primary target group (people unfamiliar with Pickleball) and I'll interview one person from the secondary target group (regular Pickleballer). I'll ask some generic questions to each target group, but will also ask individual questions based on the group they fall into.
