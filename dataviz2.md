# Assignment - Visualizing Government Debt


## Visualization 1 - This visualization is created from the OCED website and shows debt-to-GDP ratio data.

## Visualization 2 - This visualization, which is a grid of line charts, uses the same data but is created with Flourish.

## Visualization 3 - This visualization is uses the same data and is also created with Flourish, but is a race of bar charts.

Although all three of the charts above are created from the same data, there are some key differences in the ways they display it. Visualization 1 only gives information about a single year's worth of data. In other words, it is a "snapshot" of the data over the longer timeline. Visualizations 2 and 3 both display information over a longer period of time for the different countries. 

Visualizations 2 and 3 display the exact same data as each other but in substantially different ways. First, some slight alterations to the data were made in order to formulate visualization 3. Visualization 3 uses the cumulative sum of the debt-to-GDP ratios for the countries in the dataset. Visualization 2 is much larger in terms of space because displays the data over time for each country in a separate chart, where visualization 3 is more focused on telling the story of just the top countries. In terms of color, visualization 2 does not use color to distinguish between different countries because each country has its own mini chart. Visualization 3 uses color to distingish between the different countries. The color differences help the reader keep continuity with the countries as they move left and right as the values change over time. The color scheme is meant to help easily distinguish between countries without being obnoxious colors that take away attention from the primary focus. The bar chart race visualization overall helps to keep the reader engaged and is meant to be a fun and dynamic way of telling the story without needing a massive grid. One primary downside to visualization 3 is that it does not convey the information for all the countries included in the dataset. If there is significant interest in all the countries in the dataset, visualization 2 is a more appropriate chart.
