# This is my submission for the Visualizing Government Debt assignment


## Visualization 1 - This visualization is created from the OCED website and shows debt-to-GDP ratio data.

## Visualization 2 - This visualization, which is a grid of line charts, uses the same data but is created with Flourish.

## Visualization 3 - This visualization is uses the same data and is also created with Flourish, but is a race of bar charts.

Although all three of the charts above are created from the same data, there are some key differences in the ways they display it. Visualization 1 only gives information about a single year's worth of data. In other words, it is a "snapshot" of the data over the longer timeline. Visualizations 2 and 3 both display information over a longer period of time for the different countries. 

Visualizations 2 and 3 display the exact same data as each other but in substantially different ways. First, some slight alterations to the data were made in order to formulate visualization 3. Visualization 3 uses the cumulative sum of the debt-to-GDP ratios for the countries in the dataset. Visualization is much larger in terms of space and therefore displays the data over time for each country in a separate chart, where visualization 3 is more focused on telling the story of just the top countries.
